## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --no-site-packages env
source env/bin/activate
```

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup
When testing locally, models.py should be:
```python
# database_path = os.environ['DATABASE_URL']

database_filename = "database.db"
project_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
database_path = "sqlite:///{}".format(os.path.join(project_dir, database_filename))
```
When testing on heroku, models.py should be:
```python
database_path = os.environ['DATABASE_URL']

# database_filename = "database.db"
# project_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
# database_path = "sqlite:///{}".format(os.path.join(project_dir, database_filename))
```

From the working folder in terminal run:
```bash
python manage.py db init
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade
```

## Running the server locally

To run the server, execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Running the server on heroku

I have already deployed the API in heroku and can use it directly. The host is:

https://casting-agency-fxzero.herokuapp.com/movie

The token is in the `setup.sh`, you can test the API like this:

```bash
source setup.sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN_EP}" https://casting-agency-fxzero.herokuapp.com/movies | jq 
```
